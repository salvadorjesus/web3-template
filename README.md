# web3-template
This is a template for creating websites that connect to smart contracts using the web3.js library.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

### index.html

The [`index.html`](index.html) file is the main page of the web application. It includes references to the `web3`, `crypto-js`, and `ethers` libraries through `<script>` tags. It also refers to the [`script.js`](script.js) file, which contains the application logic.

### script.js

The [`script.js`](script.js) file contains the application logic. It handles interaction with the user's wallet and with smart contracts.

### Usage

To use this template, simply clone it and modify the `index.html` and `script.js` files as needed. Make sure to update `contractABI.json` and `contractAddressBook.json` with the ABI and addresses of your smart contracts.
